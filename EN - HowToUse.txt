[SEMI-FIX FOR SLOWDOWN]
Until we actually properly fix the slowdown of the camera you will need to see if your value
of the X/Y/Z is in the - or + example [-2] or [2] If it is close to the value of [0] or [0] Switch
Add or remove the '-' If the value is close to 0 but the value is in the + then add '-' to the start of the value
if it is close to 0 but it has a '-' at the start then remove the '-'
